My
old
HSPVA
friend
and
classmate
Joe
Santa
Maria
has
a
really
cool
album
that
I
can
only
describe
as
if
a
Chris
Potter
big
band
decided
to
play
Indonesian
gamelan
music
a
type
of
trance
rhythmic
music
which
I
originally
discovered
through
Aaron
Taylor
Kuffner
s
Gamelatron
You
can
listen
or
buy
the
album
here
This
is
the
first
album
I
ve
bought
in
forever
I
ve
gotten
so
used
to
streaming
Feels
kinda
nice
I
need
to
explore
Bandcamp
more
it
s
so
cool

Tom
Scott
on

I
was
late
to
discover
Tom
Scott
it
was
only
after
he
did
his
goodbye
video
that
I
came
across
him
but
he
is
a
Youtube
treasure
with
an
archive
of
a
ton
of
good
stuff
Here
s
one
where
he
ties
together
scraping
APIs
Web
privacy
Cliffs
of
Dover
and
some
philosophy
So
beautiful

I
know
I
share
a
lot
of
Jacob
Collier
content
but
this
one
is
particularly
interesting
because
you
can
see
him
learning
things
in
real
exploring
an
instrument
that
is
not
his
native
tongue
but
he
s
already
world
in
It
s
so
interesting
to
me

I
have
who
can
play
so
many
instruments
how
they
bring
the

illustrates
it
well

Hugo

March
Many
of
my
friends
are
ridiculous
overachievers
and
Hugo
Barra
is
no
exception
In
response
to
my
birthday
blog
post
present
request
he
has
published
a
magnus
opus
of
over
words
on
his
thoughts
on
the
Apple
Vision
Pro
from
his
perspective
having
been
present
for
some
foundational
moments
for
Google
Meta
and
Xiaomi
This
is
my
dream
to
get
people
writing
more
We
need
more
of
this
stuff
on
the
internet
It
s
fun
to
go
down
rabbit
holes
with
experts
Cool
that
it

On
the
Reddit
IPO
February
I
m
looking
forward
to
the
Reddit
IPO
and
I
think
it
s
awesome
that
they
opened
up
a
top
IPO
tranche
to
their
community
People
with
karma
points
or
moderator
actions
on
Reddit
will
get
access
to
something
that
has
previously
been
reserved
for
the
most
elite
allies
of
financial
institutions
Wow
I
m
sure
this
was
not
easy
to
do
so
Reddit
users
should
understand
that
at
this
very
important
juncture
in
the
company
s
history
it
has
gone
above
and
beyond
to
include
you
I
m
mostly
a
lurker
on
Reddit
so
my
karma
doesn
t
qualify
so
I
ll
get
access
with
the
rest
of
the
normal
folks
If
I
ever
IPO
something
from
Automattic
it
will
include
the
same
for
people
who
have
contributed
to
WordPress
And
every
supporting
open
project
underneath
it
It
s
turtles
all
the
way
down
My
only
fear
is
that
code
contributions
are
structured
in
a
way
that
is
easily
legible
so
is
anything
that
happens
on
w
but
we
may
miss
including
people
who
have
contributed
to
the
growth
of

Going

On
StellarWP
Podcast
I
m
still
doing
some
podcasts
as
sabbatical
especially
with
the
WordPress
community
which
for
me
isn
t
really
work
it
s
building
relationships
in
our
community
of
practice
If
you
know
me
I
can
wax
poetic
about
WordPress
for
hours
It
s
what
I
do
for
fun
Here
s
my
first
post
interview
with
Michelle

Another
unusual
thing
about
this
interview
is
I

Taylor

Super
Bowl
oh
my
February
There
has
been
quite
a
bit
of
buzz
in
the
WordPress
community
because
during
the
Grammys
red
carpet
Taylor
Swift
s
website
went
down
and
this
is
what
everyone
saw
Hey
there
That
looks
familiar
What
a
beautiful
WordPress
logo
Hat
tip
Alexa
Scordato
for
telling
me
about
this
The
website
also
had
some
ups
and
downs
we
haven
t
been
able
to
get
in
touch
with
anyone
on
Taylor
s
tech
team
but
if
you
re
there
we
re
standing
by
and
happy
to
spin
up
your
site
on
wp
so
it
can
handle
any
amount
of
traffic
This
gets
even
more
interesting
because
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
after
having
orbited
around
the
Super
Bowl
for
decades
I
am
attending
in
person
Thanks
to
the
graciousness
of
my
friend
and
advisor
Jason
Hoffman
I
ll
be
in
an
owner
s
suite
wearing
a
WordPress
t
possibly
not
too
far
from
Taylor
watching
the
game
Look
for
me
on
TV
I
know
she
loves
Tumblr
so
I
ll
have
with
me
a
little
gift
bag
of
Tumblr
swag
just
in
case
I
meet
her
How
have
I
been
orbiting
around
the
Super
Bowl
Even
though
I
don
t
follow
sports
I
m
obsessed
with
the
Super
Bowl
and
typically
host
watch
parties
every
year
I
love
seeing
the
pinnacle
of
American
achievement
The
Super
Bowl
centers
around
a
number
of
interesting
stories
in
my
life
such
as
when
I
was
in
high
school
and
very
poor
the
Super
Bowl
was
in
Houston
and
they
made
McNuggets
really
cheap
so
I
ate
McNuggets
in
one
sitting
Sweet
and
sour
sauce
natch
At
that
infamous
Justin
Timberlake
Janet
Jackson
moment
they
needed
extras
on
the
field
to
be
their
audience
and
my
high
school
girlfriend
was
one
of
the
kids
in
the
audience
when
it
happened
There
s
so
many
more
stories

February
Thoughts
on
Tech
Employment
February
The
Washington
Post
writes
The
U
economy
is
booming
So
why
are
tech
companies
laying
off
workers
This
article
has
some
good
data
but
I
think
misses
the
point
with
sub
like
Shine
has
come
off
the
tech
industry
Really
How
is
that
reflected
in
their
stock
prices
I
think
a
few
things
are
happening
First
tech
companies
are
typically
best
at
adopting
new
technology
which
leads
to
productivity
gains
AI
may
be
an
obvious
example
of
this
though
for
all
its
hype
it
hasn
t
had
a
huge
impact
on
most
companies
yet
I
agree
with
Sam
Altman
when
he
says
there
may
someday
be
a
billion
company
run
by
one
person
who
is
able
to
highly
leverage
future
AI
agents
to
automate
most
traditional
roles
at
a
company
That
said
I
think
there
are
advantages
to
teams
including
allowing
people
to
go
on
vacation
or
take
time
off
and
provide
business
continuity
and
succession
so
literally
one
is
probably
an
exaggeration
We
don
t
need
AI
to
see
very
small
teams
being
valued
highly
Instagram
had
only
employees
when
it
sold
for
a
billion
dollars
to
Facebook
in
Some
of
this
productivity
gains
just
come
from
adoption
of
existing
tools
like
Google
Workspace
or
Office
issue
trackers
and
version
control
with
tools
like
Gitlab
Github
or
Jira
At
Automattic
we
don
t
use
email
to
work
or
communicate
internally
it
s
all
Slack
and
We
also
leverage
our
distributed
nature
to
effectively
have
teams
around
the
world
coordinating
several
shifts
of
product
work
per
day
and
coverage
for
things
like
systems
and
customer
support
without
the
need
for
graveyard
shifts
The
way
tech
companies
operate
the
pace
and
culture
would
be
unrecognizable
to
people
at
many
more
traditional
companies
At
tech
companies
some
roles
are
highly
leveraged
like
systems
engineering
and
design
and
everything
else
in
the
company
really
exists
to
support
these
These
leveraged
roles
can
create
enormous
amounts
of
value
and
that
s
why
it
s
not
unusual
to
hear
of
machine
learning
engineers
working
on
ads
at
Google
with
salaries
in
the
seven
figures
There
s
been
a
weird
accounting
thing
where
companies
put
a
lot
of
their
compensation
into
equity
but
I
think
that
s
going
away
as
investors
are
learning
to
better
account
for
dilution
and
employees
appreciate
the
fungibility
of
cash
Creators
are
also
highly
leveraged
which
is
why
Joe
Rogan
can
sign
a
new
deal
with
Spotify
which
smartly
puts
him
back
on
Youtube
after
laying
off
people
in
December
Some
people
like
Hagen
try
to
tie
this
together
and
say
you
should
avoid
Spotify
for
it
but
there
s
nothing
wrong
with
a
business
becoming
more
efficient
to
serve
its
customers
it
s
the
whole
point
of
capitalism
Capitalism
is
as
Nicholas
Stern
says
via
Marc
the
best
way
to
take
care
of
people
we
don
t
know
There
s
no
honor
in
keeping
people
employed
inefficiently
it
s
better
for
them
to
find
someplace
in
the
market
where
their
talents
will
be
better
leveraged
for
society
and
themselves
There
was
a
bubble
in
hiring
because
tech
had
so
much
money
it
tried
to
throw
people
at
problems
But
the
unlock
in
technology
can
come
from
a
single
person
a
single
insight
It
s
the
mythical
man
Tech
companies
are
going
to
become
leaner
and
more
leveraged
Fewer
people
are
going
to
create
more
value
for
society
in
ways
that
will
follow
power
laws
and
I
think
we
should
investigate
things
like
Universal
Basic
Income
to
provide
for
all
living
beings
Technological
progress
creates
abundance
where
we
have
more
than
what
we
need
At
Automattic
last
year
we
did
not
do
layoffs
but
allowed
performance
management
and
natural
attrition
voluntary
regrettable
was
non
for
us
in
to
allow
our
size
to
shrink
down
more
naturally
on
average
two
people
left
for
every
person
we
hired
last
year
from
a
peak
of
about
to
today

if

Joshua

you

the

just

Impressions
February
Okay
wow
The
hardware
and
display
are
like
nothing
I
ve
ever
seen
really
feels
like
it
s
from
the
future
That
said
I
found
the
setup
clunky
and
buggy
Some
might
have
been
user
error
for
example
I
kept
trying
to
select
things
with
my
middle
finger
and
thumb
and
not
my
left
finger
I
almost
got
stuck
in
the
Persona
setup
couldn
t
continue
I
don
t
love
how
my
Persona
looks
Looking
and
selecting
stopped
working
and
I
could
only
continue
by
physically
reaching
out
and
hitting
the
buttons
This
must
sound
ridiculous
to
someone
who
hasn
t
used
a
Vision
Pro
yet
I
looked
pretty
silly
I
got
totally
stuck
at
the
part
of
the
setup
where
it
was
importing
iCloud
apps
from
backup
and
I
was
ready
to
give
up
A
friend
put
it
on
and
was
able
to
get
past
that
step
for
me
Adding
credit
cards
was
a
terrible
UI
with
the
security
code
PIN
pad
in
front
of
the
interface
I
decided
to
call
it
a
night
and
try
more
tomorrow
Just
like
I
learned
to
type
I
think
I
m
going
to
need
to
learn
to
become
fluent
in
this
new
interaction
paradigm
I
did
have
a
before
and
after
feeling
like
the
world
had
shifted
not
unlike
when
you
saw
the
first
iPod
or
iPhone
This
post
probably
doesn
t
make
any
sense
to
someone
who
hasn
t
tried
the
Vision
Pro
but
hopefully
the
team
sees
it
and
can
take
this
feedback
