Introduction
to
the
structure
of
an
HTML
document
An
HTML
document
is
composed
of
three
parts
a
line
containing
HTML
version
information
a
declarative
header
section
delimited
by
the
HEAD
element
a
body
which
contains
the
document
actual
content
The
body
may
be
implemented
by
the
BODY
element
or
the
FRAMESET
element
White
space
spaces
newlines
tabs
and
comments
may
appear
before
or
after
each
section
Sections
and
should
be
delimited
by
the
HTML
element
Here

a
simple

is
used
in
the

The
document
type
declaration
names
the
document
type
definition
DTD
in
use
for
the
document
see
HTML
specifies
three
DTDs
so
authors
must
include
one
of
the
following
document
type
declarations
in
their
documents
The
DTDs
vary
in
the
elements
they
support
The
HTML
Strict
DTD
includes
all
elements
and
attributes
that
have
not
been
deprecated
or
do
not
appear
in
frameset
documents
For
documents
that
use
this
DTD
use
this
document
type
declaration
DOCTYPE
HTML
PUBLIC
HTML
http
The
HTML
Transitional
DTD
includes
everything
in
the
strict
DTD
plus
deprecated
elements
and
attributes
most
of
which
concern
visual
presentation
For
documents
that
use
this
DTD
use
this
document
type
declaration
DOCTYPE
HTML
PUBLIC
HTML

http
The
HTML
Frameset
DTD
includes
everything
in
the
transitional
DTD
plus
frames
as
well
For
documents
that
use
this
DTD
use
this
document
type
declaration
DOCTYPE

The
URI
in
each
document
type
declaration
allows
user
agents
to
download
the
DTD
and
any
entity
sets
that
are
needed

recommended
by
the
Oasis

Note
As
of
the
December
version
of
HTML
the
HTML
Working
Group
commits
to
the
following
policy
Any
changes
to
future
HTML
DTDs
will
not
invalidate
documents
that
conform
to
the
DTDs
of
the
present
specification
The
HTML
Working
Group
reserves
the
right
to
correct
known
bugs
Software
conforming
to
the
DTDs
of
the
present
specification
may
ignore
features
of
future
HTML
DTDs
that
it
does
not
recognize
This
means
that
in
a
document
type
declaration
authors
may
safely
use
a
system
identifier
that
refers
to
the
latest
version
of
an
HTML
DTD
Authors
may
also
choose
to
use
a
system

that
refers
to
a
specific
dated
version
of
an
HTML
DTD
when

Every
HTML
document
must
have
a
TITLE
element
in
the
HEAD
section
Authors
should
use
the
TITLE
element
to
identify
the
contents
of
a
document
Since
users
often
consult
documents
out
of
context
authors
should
provide
context
titles
Thus
instead
of
a
title
such
as
Introduction
which
does
n
provide
much
contextual
background
authors
should
supply
a
title
such
as
Introduction
to
Medieval
Bee
instead
For
reasons
of
accessibility
user
agents
must
always
make
the
content
of
the
TITLE
element
available
to
users
including
TITLE
elements
that
occur
in
frames
The
mechanism
for
doing
so
depends
on
the
user
agent
e
as
a
caption
spoken
Titles
may
contain
character
entities
for
accented
characters
special
characters
etc
but
may
not
contain
other
markup
including

Unlike
the

the

Values
of
the
title

may
be
rendered
by
user
agents
in
a
variety
of
ways
For
instance
visual
browsers
frequently
display
the

as
a
tool
tip
a
short

that
appears
when
the
pointing
device
pauses
over

Audio
user
agents
may
speak
the

in
a
similar
context
For
example
setting
the

on
a

allows
user
agents
visual

to
designate
an
external

Note
To
improve
the
quality
of
speech
synthesis
for
cases
handled
poorly
by
standard
techniques
future
versions
of
HTML
may
include
an
attribute
for
encoding
phonemic
and
prosodic
information
Meta
data
Note
The
Resource
Description
Framework
see
became
a
Recommendation
in
February
RDF
allows
authors
to
specify
machine
metadata
about
HTML
documents
and
other
network
resources
HTML
lets
authors
specify
meta
data
information
about
a
document
rather
than
document
content
in
a
variety
of
ways
For
example
to
specify
the
author
of
a
document
one
may
use
the
META
element
as
follows
META
name
Author
content
Dave
Raggett
The
META
element
specifies
a
property
here
Author
and
assigns
a
value
to
it
here
Dave
Raggett
This
specification
does
not
define
a
set
of
legal
meta
data
properties
The
meaning
of
a
property
and
the
set
of
legal
values
for
that
property
should
be
defined
in
a
reference
lexicon
called
a
profile
For
example
a
profile
designed
to
help
search
engines
index
documents
might
define
properties
such
as
author
copyright
keywords
etc
Specifying
meta
data
In
general
specifying
meta
data
involves
two
steps
Declaring
a
property
and
a
value
for
that
property
This
may
be
done
in
two
ways
From
within
a
document
via
the
META
element
From
outside
a
document
by
linking
to
meta
data
via
the
LINK
element
see
the
section
on
link
types
Referring
to
a
profile
where
the
property
and
its
legal
values
are
defined
To
designate
a
profile
use
the
profile
attribute
of
the
HEAD
element
Note
that
since
a
profile
is
defined
for
the
HEAD
element
the
same
profile
applies
to
all
META
and
LINK
elements
in
the
document
head
User
agents
are
not
required
to
support
meta

mechanisms
For
those
that

The
META
element
can
be
used
to
identify
properties
of
a
document
e
author
expiration
date
a
list
of
key
words
etc
and
assign
values
to
those
properties
This
specification
does
not
define
a
normative
set
of
properties
Each
META
element
specifies
a
property
pair
The
name
attribute
identifies
the
property
and
the
content
attribute
specifies
the
property
value
For
example
the
following
declaration
sets
a
value
for
the
Author
property
META
name
Author
content
Dave
Raggett
The
lang
attribute
can
be
used
with
META
to
specify
the
language
for
the
value
of
the
content
attribute
This
enables
speech
synthesizers
to
apply
language
dependent
pronunciation
rules
In
this
example
the
author
name
is
declared
to
be
French
META
name
Author
lang

Arnaud
Le
Hors
Note
The
META
element
is
a
generic
mechanism
for
specifying
meta
data
However
some
HTML
elements
and
attributes
already
handle
certain
pieces
of
meta
data
and
may
be
used
by
authors
instead
of
META
to
specify
those
pieces
the
TITLE
element
the
ADDRESS
element
the
INS
and
DEL
elements
the
title
attribute
and
the
cite
attribute
Note
When
a
property
specified
by
a
META
element
takes
a
value
that
is
a
URI
some
authors
prefer
to
specify
the
meta
data
via
the
LINK
element
Thus
the
following
meta
data
declaration
META
name
DC
content
http
might
also
be
written
LINK
rel
DC
type
text
href
http
META
and
HTTP
headers
The
http
attribute
can
be
used
in
place
of
the
name
attribute
and
has
a
special
significance
when
documents
are
retrieved
via
the
Hypertext
Transfer
Protocol
HTTP
HTTP
servers
may
use
the
property
name
specified
by
the
http
attribute
to
create
an
header
in
the
HTTP
response
Please
see
the
HTTP
specification
for
details
on
valid
HTTP
headers
The
following
sample
META
declaration
META
http
Expires
content
Tue
Aug
GMT
will
result
in
the
HTTP
header
Expires
Tue
Aug
GMT
This
can
be
used
by
caches
to
determine
when
to
fetch
a
fresh
copy
of
the
associated
document
Note
Some
user
agents
support
the
use
of
META
to
refresh
the
current
page
after
a
specified
number
of
seconds
with
the
option
of
replacing
it
by
a
different
URI
Authors
should
not
use
this
technique
to
forward
users
to
different
pages
as
this
makes
the
page
inaccessible
to
some
users
Instead
automatic
page
forwarding
should
be
done
using
server
redirects
META
and
search
engines
A
common
use
for
META
is
to
specify
keywords
that
a
search
engine
may
use
to
improve
the
quality
of
search
results
When
several
META
elements
provide
language
information
about
a
document
search
engines
may
filter
on
the
lang
attribute
to
display
search
results
using
the
language
preferences
of
the
user
For
example
For
speakers
of
US
English
META

For

META

The
effectiveness
of
search
engines
can
also
be
increased
by
using
the
LINK
element
to
specify
links
to
translations
of
the
document
in
other
languages
links
to
versions
of
the
document
in
other
media
e
PDF
and
when
the
document
is
part
of
a
collection
links
to
an
appropriate
starting
point
for
browsing
the
collection

Meta
data
profiles
The
profile
attribute
of
the
HEAD
specifies
the
location
of
a
meta
data
profile
The
value
of
the
profile
attribute
is
a
URI
User
agents
may
use
this
URI
in
two
ways
As
a
globally
unique
name
User
agents
may
be
able
to
recognize
the
name
without
actually
retrieving
the
profile
and
perform
some
activity
based
on
known
conventions
for
that
profile
For
instance
search
engines
could
provide
an
interface
for
searching
through
catalogs
of
HTML
documents
where
these
documents
all
use
the
same
profile
for
representing
catalog
entries
As
a
link
User
agents
may
dereference
the
URI
and
perform
some
activity
based
on
the
actual
definitions
within
the
profile
e
authorize
the
usage
of
the
profile
within
the
current
HTML
document
This
specification
does
not
define
formats
for
profiles
This
example
refers
to
a
hypothetical
profile
that
defines
useful
properties
for
document
indexing
The
properties
defined
by
this
profile
including
author
copyright
keywords
and

have
their
values
set

As
this

it
is
common
practice
to
use
the

described
in

As
these
formats
are
relatively
hard
to
process
we
recommend
that
authors
use
the

provide
user
agents
more
context
for
the
correct
interpretation
of
meta
data
At
times
such
additional
information
may
be
critical
as
when
meta
data
may
be
specified
in
different
formats
For
example
an
author
might
specify
a
date
in
the
ambiguous
format
does
this
mean
October
or
September
The
scheme
attribute
value
Month
would
disambiguate
this
date
value
At
other
times
the
scheme
attribute
may
provide
helpful
but
non
information
to
user
agents
For
example
the
following
scheme
declaration
may
help
a
user
agent
determine
that
the
value
of
the
identifier
property
is
an
ISBN
code
number
META
scheme
ISBN
name
identifier
content
Values
for
the
scheme
attribute
depend
on
the
property
name
and
the
associated
profile
Note
One
sample
profile
is
the
Dublin
Core
see
DCORE
This
profile
defines
a

The
body
of
a
document
contains
the
document
content
The
content
may
be
presented
by
a
user
agent
in
a
variety
of
ways
For
example
for
visual
browsers
you
can
think
of
the
body
as
a
canvas
where
the
content
appears
text
images
colors
graphics
etc
For
audio
user
agents
the
same
content
may
be
spoken
Since
style

are
now
the
preferred
way
to
specify
a

the
presentational

Element
identifiers
the
id
and
class
attributes
Attribute
definitions
id
name
CS
This
attribute
assigns
a
name
to
an
element
This
name
must
be
unique
in
a
document
class
cdata
CS
This
attribute
assigns
a
class
name
or
set
of
class
names
to
an
element
Any
number
of
elements
may
be
assigned
the
same
class
name
or
names
Multiple
class
names
must
be
separated
by
white
space
characters
The
id
attribute
assigns
a
unique
identifier
to
an
element
which
may
be
verified
by
an
SGML
parser
For
example
the
following
paragraphs
are
distinguished
by
their
id
values
P
id
myparagraph
This
is
a
uniquely
named
paragraph
P
id
yourparagraph
This
is
also
a
uniquely
named
paragraph
The
id
attribute
has
several
roles
in
HTML
As
a
style
sheet
selector
As
a
target
anchor
for
hypertext
links
As
a
means
to
reference
a
particular
element
from
a
script
As
the
name
of
a
declared
OBJECT
element
For
general
purpose
processing
by
user
agents
e
for
identifying
fields
when
extracting
data
from
HTML
pages
into
a
database
translating
HTML
documents
into
other
formats
etc
The
class
attribute
on
the
other
hand
assigns
one
or
more
class
names
to
an
element
the
element
may
be
said
to
belong
to
these
classes
A
class
name
may
be
shared
by
several
element
instances
The
class
attribute
has
several
roles
in
HTML
As
a
style
sheet
selector
when
an
author
wishes
to
assign
style
information
to
a
set
of
elements
For
general
purpose
processing
by
user

In
the
following
example
the
SPAN
element
is
used
in

Note
that
the

since
they
share
the
same
id
value
Authors
may
make
further
use
of
the
id
attribute
to
refine
the
presentation
of
individual
messages
make
them
target
anchors
etc
Almost
every
HTML
element
may
be
assigned
identifier
and
class
information
Suppose
for
example
that
we
are
writing
a
document
about
a
programming
language
The
document
is
to
include
a
number
of
preformatted
examples
We
use
the
PRE
element
to
format
the
examples
We
also
assign
a
background
color
green
to
all
instances
of
the
PRE
element
belonging
to
the
class
example

By
setting

attribute
for
this
example
we
can
create

to
it
and
override
class
style
information
with
instance
style
information
Note
The
id
attribute
shares
the
same
name
space
as
the
name
attribute
when
used
for
anchor
names
Please
consult
the
section
on
anchors
with
id
for
more
information
Block
and
inline
elements
Certain
HTML
elements
that
may
appear
in
BODY
are
said
to
be
block
while
others
are
inline
also
known
as
text
level
The
distinction
is
founded
on
several
notions
Content
model
Generally
block
elements
may
contain
inline
elements
and
other
block
elements
Generally
inline
elements
may
contain
only
data
and
other
inline
elements
Inherent
in
this
structural
distinction
is
the
idea
that
block
elements
create
larger
structures
than
inline
elements
Formatting
By
default
block
elements
are
formatted
differently
than
inline
elements
Generally
block
elements
begin
on
new
lines
inline
elements
do
not
For
information
about
white
space
line
breaks
and
block
formatting
please
consult
the
section
on
text
Directionality
For
technical
reasons
involving
the
UNICODE
bidirectional
text
algorithm
block
and
inline
elements
differ
in
how
they
inherit
directionality
information
For
details
see
the
section
on
inheritance
of
text
direction
Style
sheets
provide
the
means
to
specify
the
rendering
of
arbitrary
elements
including
whether
an
element
is
rendered
as
block
or
inline
In
some
cases
such
as
an
inline
style
for
list
elements
this
may
be
appropriate
but
generally
speaking
authors
are
discouraged
from
overriding
the
conventional
interpretation
of
HTML
elements
in
this
way
The
alteration
of
the
traditional
presentation
idioms
for
block
level
and
inline
elements
also
has
an
impact
on
the
bidirectional
text
algorithm

The
DIV
and
SPAN
elements
in
conjunction
with
the
id
and
class
attributes
offer
a
generic
mechanism
for
adding
structure
to
documents
These
elements
define
content
to
be
inline
SPAN
or
block
DIV
but
impose
no
other
presentational
idioms
on
the
content
Thus
authors
may
use
these
elements
in
conjunction
with
style
sheets
the
lang
attribute
etc
to
tailor
HTML
to
their
own
needs
and
tastes
Suppose
for
example
that
we
wanted
to
generate
an
HTML
document
based
on
a
database
of
client
information
Since
HTML
does
not
include
elements
that
identify
objects
such
as
client
telephone
number
email
address
etc
we
use
DIV
and
SPAN
to
achieve
the
desired
structural
and
presentational
effects
We
might
use
the
TABLE
element
as
follows
to
structure
the
information
Example
of
data
from
the
client
database

Later
we
may
easily
add
style
sheet
declarations
to
fine
tune
the
presentation
of
these
database
entries
For
another
example
of
usage
please
consult
the
example
in
the
section
on
the
class

Visual

generally

A

element
briefly
describes
the
topic
of
the
section
it
introduces
Heading
information
may
be
used
by
user
agents
for
example
to
construct
a
table
of
contents
for
a
document
automatically
There
are
six
levels
of
headings
in
HTML
with
as
the
most
important
and
as
the
least
Visual
browsers
usually
render
more
important
headings
in
larger
fonts
than
less
important
ones
The
following
example
shows
how
to
use
the
DIV
element
to
associate
a
heading
with
the
document
section
that
follows
it
Doing
so
allows
you
to
define
a
