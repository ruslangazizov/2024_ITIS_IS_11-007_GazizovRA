Introduction
to
links
and
anchors
HTML
offers
many
of
the
conventional
publishing
idioms
for
rich
text
and
structured
documents
but
what
separates
it
from
most
other
markup
languages
is
its
features
for
hypertext
and
interactive
documents
This
section
introduces
the
link
or
hyperlink
or
Web
link
the
basic
hypertext
construct
A
link
is
a
connection
from
one
Web
resource
to
another
Although
a
simple
concept
the
link
has
been
one
of
the
primary
forces
driving
the
success
of
the
Web
A
link
has
two
ends
called
anchors
and
a
direction
The
link
starts
at
the
source
anchor
and
points
to
the
destination
anchor
which
may
be
any
Web
resource
e
an
image
a
video
clip
a
sound
bite
a
program
an
HTML
document
an
element
within
an
HTML
document
etc
Visiting
a
linked
resource
The
default
behavior
associated
with
a
link
is
the
retrieval
of
another
Web
resource
This
behavior
is
commonly
and
implicitly
obtained
by
selecting
the
link
e
by
clicking
through
keyboard
input
etc
The
following
HTML
excerpt
contains
two
links
one
whose
destination
anchor
is
an
HTML
document
named
and
the
other
whose
destination
anchor
is

A

map
of
the

forest
By
activating
these
links
by
clicking
with
the
mouse
through
keyboard
input
voice
commands
etc
users
may
visit
these
resources
Note
that
the
href
attribute
in
each
source
anchor
specifies
the
address
of
the
destination
anchor
with
a
URI
The
destination
anchor
of
a
link
may
be
an
element
within
an
HTML
document
The
destination
anchor
must
be
given
an
anchor
name
and
any
URI
addressing
this
anchor
must
include
the
name
as
its
fragment
identifier
Destination
anchors
in
HTML
documents
may
be
specified
either
by
the
A
element
naming
it
with
the
name
attribute
or
by
any
other
element
naming
with
the
id
attribute
Thus
for
example
an
author
might
create
a
table
of
contents
whose
entries
link
to
header
elements
etc
in
the
same
document
Using
the
A
element
to
create
destination
anchors
we
would
write

Other
link
relationships
By
far
the
most
common
use
of
a
link
is
to
retrieve
another
Web
resource
as
illustrated
in
the
previous
examples
However
authors
may
insert
links
in
their
documents
that
express
other
relationships
between
resources
than
simply
activate
this
link
to
visit
that
related
resource
Links
that
express
other
types
of
relationships
have
one
or
more
link
types
specified
in
their
source
anchor
The
roles
of
a
link
defined
by
A
or
LINK
are
specified
via
the
rel
and
rev
attributes
For
instance
links
defined
by
the
LINK
element
may
describe
the
position
of
a
document
within
a
series
of
documents
In
the
following
excerpt
links
within
the
document
entitled
Chapter
point
to
the
previous
and
next
chapters
HEAD

The
link
type
of
the
first
link
is
prev
and
that
of
the
second
is
next
two
of
several
recognized
link
types
Links
specified
by
LINK
are
not
rendered
with
the
document
contents
although
user
agents
may
render
them
in
other
ways
e
as
navigation
tools
Even
if
they
are
not
used
for
navigation
these
links
may
be
interpreted
in
interesting
ways
For
example
a
user
agent
that
prints
a
series
of
HTML
documents
as
a
single
document
may
use
this
link
information
as
the
basis
of
forming
a
coherent
linear
document
Further
information
is
given
below
on
using
links
for
the
benefit
of
search
engines
Specifying
anchors
and
links
Although
several
HTML
elements
and
attributes
create
links
to
other
resources
e
the
IMG
element
the
FORM
element
etc
this
chapter
discusses
links
and
anchors
created
by
the
LINK
and
A
elements
The
LINK
element
may
only
appear
in
the
head
of
a
document
The
A
element
may
only
appear
in
the
body
When
the
A
element
href
attribute
is
set
the
element
defines
a
source
anchor
for
a
link
that
may
be
activated
by
the
user
to
retrieve
a
Web
resource
The
source
anchor
is
the
location
of
the
A
instance
and
the
destination
anchor
is
the
Web
resource
The
retrieved
resource
may
be
handled
by
the
user
agent
in
several
ways
by
opening
a
new
HTML
document
in
the
same
user
agent
window
opening
a
new
HTML
document
in
a
different
window
starting
a
new
program
to
handle
the
resource
etc
Since
the
A
element
has
content
text
images
etc
user
agents
may
render
this
content
in
such
a
way
as
to
indicate
the
presence
of
a
link
e
by
underlining
the
content
When
the
name
or
id
attributes
of
the
A
element
are
set
the
element
defines
an
anchor
that
may
be
the
destination
of
other
links
Authors
may
set
the
name
and
href
attributes
simultaneously
in
the
same
A
instance
The
LINK
element
defines
a
relationship
between
the
current
document
and
another
resource
Although
LINK
has
no
content
the
relationships
it
defines
may
be
rendered
by
some
user
agents
Link
titles
The
title
attribute
may
be
set
for
both
A
and
LINK
to
add
information
about
the
nature
of
a
link
This
information
may
be
spoken
by
a
user
agent
rendered
as
a
tool
tip
cause
a
change
in
cursor
image
etc
Thus
we
may
augment
a
previous
example
by
supplying
a
title
for
each
link

Internationalization
and
links
Since
links
may
point
to
documents
encoded
with
different
character
encodings
the
A
and
LINK
elements
support
the
charset
attribute
This
attribute
allows
authors
to
advise
user
agents
about
the
encoding
of
data
at
the
other
end
of
the
link
The
hreflang
attribute
provides
user
agents
with
information
about
the
language
of
a
resource
at
the
end
of
a
link
just
as
the
lang
attribute
provides
information
about
the
language
of
an
element
content
or
attribute
values
Armed
with
this
additional
knowledge
user
agents
should
be
able
to
avoid
presenting
garbage
to
the
user
Instead
they
may
either
locate
resources
necessary
for
the
correct
presentation
of
the
document
or
if
they
can
not
locate
the
resources
they
should
at
least
warn
the
user
that
the
document
will
be
unreadable
and
explain
the
cause

Suppose
we

the
file
one
text
before
the
anchor
A
name
anchor
This
is
the
location
of
anchor
one
text
after
the
anchor
This
creates
an
anchor
around
the
text
This
is
the
location
of
anchor
one
Usually
the
contents
of
A
are
not
rendered
in
any
special
way
when
A
defines
an
anchor
only
Having
defined
the
anchor
we
may
link
to
it
from
the
same
or
another
document
URIs
that
designate

contain
a

The
A

in
the

This
example
contains
a
link
to
a
different
type
of
Web
resource
a
PNG
image
Activating
the
link
should
cause
the
image
resource
to
be
retrieved
from
the
Web
and
possibly
displayed
if
the
system
has
been
configured
to
do
so
Note
User
agents
should
be
able
to
find
anchors
created
by
empty
A
elements
but
some
fail
to
do
so
For
example
some
user

may
not
find
the

the
following
HTML
fragment
A
name
empty
EM
some
HTML
A

Link
to

Syntax
of
anchor
names
An
anchor
name
is
the
value
of
either
the
name
or
id
attribute
when
used
in
the
context
of
anchors
Anchor
names
must
observe
the
following
rules
Uniqueness
Anchor
names
must
be
unique
within
a
document
Anchor
names
that
differ
only
in
case
may
not
appear
in
the
same
document
String
matching
Comparisons
between
fragment
identifiers
and
anchor
names
must
be
done
by
exact
case
match
Thus
the
following
example
is
correct
with
respect
to
string
matching
and
must
be
considered
a
match
by
user
agents
P
A
href
xxx
more
document
P
A
name
xxx
ILLEGAL
EXAMPLE
The
following
example
is
illegal
with
respect
to
uniqueness
since
the
two
names
are
the
same
except
for
case
P
A
name
xxx
P
A
name
XXX
Although
the
following
excerpt
is
legal
HTML
the
behavior
of
the
user
agent
is
not
defined
some
user
agents
may
incorrectly
consider
this
a
match
and
others
may
not
P
A
href
xxx
more
document
P
A
name
XXX
Anchor
names
should
be
restricted
to
ASCII
characters
Please
consult
the
appendix
for
more
information
about
non
characters
in
URI
attribute
values
Nested
links
are
illegal
Links
and
anchors
defined
by
the
A
element
must
not
be
nested
an
A
element
must
not
contain
any
other
A
elements
Since
the
DTD
defines
the
LINK
element
to
be
empty
LINK
elements
may
not
be
nested
either
Anchors
with
the
id
attribute
The
id
attribute
may
be
used
to
create
an
anchor
at
the
start
tag
of
any
element
including
the
A
element
This
example
illustrates
the
use
of
the
id
attribute
to
position
an
anchor
in
an
element
The
anchor
is
linked
to
via
the
A
element

with
the

a
A

This
means
that
they
can
not
both
define
an
anchor
with
the
same
name
in
the
same
document
It
is
permissible
to
use
both
attributes
to
specify
an
element
unique

for
the
following
elements
A
APPLET
FORM
FRAME
IFRAME
IMG
and
MAP
When
both
attributes
are
used
on
a
single
element
their
values
must
be
identical
ILLEGAL
EXAMPLE

is
illegal
HTML
since
these
attributes
declare
the
same
name
twice
in
the
same
document
A
href
id
pages
and

The
following
example

Authors
should
consider
the
following
issues
when
deciding
whether
to
use
id
or
name
for
an
anchor
name
The
id
attribute
can
act
as
more
than
just
an
anchor
name
e
style
sheet
selector
processing
identifier
etc
Some
older
user

do
n
support
anchors
created
with
the
id
attribute
The
name
attribute
allows
richer
anchor
names
with
entities
Unavailable
and
unidentifiable
resources
A
reference
to
an
unavailable
or
unidentifiable
resource
is
an
error
Although
user
agents
may
vary
in
how
they
handle
such
an
error
we
recommend
the
following
behavior
If
a
user
agent
can
not
locate
a
linked
resource
it
should
alert
the
user
If
a
user
agent
can
not
identify
the
type
of
a
linked
resource
it
should
still
attempt
to
process
it
It
should
alert
the
user
and
may
allow
the

to
intervene

In
HTML
links
and
references
to
external

etc
are
always
specified
by
a
URI
Relative
URIs
are
resolved
according
to
a
base
URI
which
may
come
from
a
variety
of
sources
The
BASE
element
allows
authors
to
specify
a
document
base
URI
explicitly
When
present
the
BASE
element
must
appear
in
the
HEAD
section
of
an
HTML
document
before
any
element
that
refers
to
an
external
source
The
path
information
specified

Resolving

User

must
calculate
the
base
URI
for
resolving
relative
URIs
according
to
section
The
following
describes
how
applies
specifically
to
HTML
User
agents
must
calculate
the
base
URI
according
to
the
following
precedences
highest
priority
to
lowest
The
base
URI
is
set
by
the
BASE
element
The
base
URI
is
given
by
meta
data
discovered
during
a
protocol
interaction
such
as
an
HTTP
header
see
By
default
the
base
URI
is
that
of
the
current
document
Not
all
HTML
documents
have
a
base
URI
e
a
valid
HTML
document
may
appear
in
an
email
and
may
not
be
designated
by
a
URI
Such
HTML
documents
are
considered
erroneous
if
they
contain
relative
URIs
and
rely
on
a
default
base
URI
Additionally
the
OBJECT
and
APPLET
elements
define
attributes
that
take
precedence
over
the
value
set
by
the
BASE
element

Note
For

should
handle
