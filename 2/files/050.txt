Piano
Because
there
are
keys
on
a
standard
piano
the
day
of
the
year
was
established
as
a
day
to
celebrate
the
piano
and
everything
around
it
performers
composers
piano
builders
tuners
movers
and
most
important
the
listener
are

appreciate
that
Piano
Day
is
on
an
ordinal
day
of
the
year
rather
than
a
Gregorian
date
e
or
August
which
is
subject
to
leap
year
variances
The
day
of
the
year
is
the
day
regardless
whether
it
is
a
leap
year
or
not
a
standards
perspective
we
can
express
today
s
Piano
Day
as
an
ISO
ordinal
however
there
is
no
standard
date
format
for
just
the
day
of
a
year
without
specifying
a
year
yearless
is
was
a
way
to
specify
a
yearless
month
and
day
like
you
might
see
as
a
birthday
displayed
on
a
social
media
site
without
disclosing
the
year
or
an
annual
holiday
like
May
that
is
May
without
a
specific
year
yearless
date
format
MM
or
shorthand
MMDD
was
supported
in
the
ISO
standard
but
then
dropped
in
the
revision
This
omission
or
deliberate
removal
was
an
error
because
there
are
both
obvious
human
visible
use
communicating
holidays
and
yearless
birthdays
as
noted
above
and
other
standards
already
depended
on
this
yearless
date
format
syntax
e
and
specs
that
refer
to
it
like
hCard
and
h
version
of
ISO
since
has
this
flaw
Fixing
or
patching
is
worth
a
separate
post
to
yearless
ordinal
dates
since
they
lack
an
interchange
syntax
we
can
define
one
resembling
the
yearless
month
day
format
yet
unambiguously
parseable
as
a
yearless
ordinal
date
Piano
Day
would
be
represented
as
have
to
use
three
explicit
digits
because
there
also
pre
day
of
the
month
and
month
of
the
year
syntaxes
which
are
very
similar
but
with
two
digits
MM
yearless
ordinalDate
syntax
is
worth
proposing
as
a
delta
repair
spec
to
ISO
use
Piano
Day
and
others
like
Programmer
s
alongside
at
least
a
restoration
of
the
MM
yearless
month
day
syntax
use
publishing
holidays
and
yearless
birthdays
perhaps
also
the
day
of
the
month
and
MM
month
of
the
year
syntaxes
use
language
independent
numerical
publishing
of
Gregorian
months
and
days
of
months
and
propose
adding
a
NewCal
bim
of
the
year
syntax
B
numerically
superior
replacement
for
Gregorian
months
and
quarters

Are

why

on
While
an
HTML
style
element
for
inline
CSS
needs
nothing
but
simple
start
and
end
tags
as
of
and
later
style
p
color
red
a
more
robust
style
element
requires
a
precise
series
of
overlapping
code
comments
is
the
answer
if
you
want
a
code
snippet
to
copy
paste
style
CDATA
p
color
red
you
may
delete
this
sample
style
rule
Here
is
why
Not
all
HTML
processors
are
CSS
processors
While
all
modern
browsers
know
how
to
parse
CSS
in
style
elements
inside
HTML
it
is
still
quite
reasonable
for
people
to
build
HTML
processors
that
do
not
and
many
exist
There
are
plenty
of
ways
to
errantly
or
deliberately
misplace
markup
inside
a
style
element
like
in
a
CSS
comment
that
such
processors
will
not
see
that
can
break
them
and
cause
unexpected
and
different
results
in
different
processors
Strictly
speaking
any
use
of
child
combinator
selector
syntax
should
also
be
HTML
escaped
as
gt
inside
a
style
elment
it
makes
your
HTML
more
parseable
by
more
processors
if
you
can
hide
the
entirety
of
the
style
sheet
inside
the
style
element
from
such
processing
including
any
child
combinators
A
CDATA
section
does
exactly
that
style
CDATA
p
color
orange
CDATA
allows
a
here
to
not
close
the
element
p
margin
CDATA
also
allows
an
unescaped
child
combinator
However
CSS
syntax
does
not
recognize
a
CDATA
directive
even
as
of
the
latest
published
CSS
Syntax
Module
Level
or
editor
as
of
this
writing
CSS
parsers
may
very
well
treat
a
CDATA
directive
as
a
syntax
error
that
invalidates
the
subsequent
style
rule
we
must
hide
the
CDATA
directive
its
opening
and
closing
markup
from
CSS
parsers
CSS
code
comments
can
do
exactly
that
style
CDATA
p
color
orange
CDATA
allows
a
here
to
not
close
the
element
p
margin
CDATA
also
allows
an
unescaped
child
combinator
This
is
close
but
still
exposes
HTML
processors
that
do
not
process
CSS
to
a
minimal
bit
of
content
the
CSS
comment
opener
and
closer
that
are
outside
the
CDATA
section
recently
showed
up
in
a
draft
of
the
This
Week
in
The
IndieWeb
because
portions
of
it
are
automatically
constructed
by
parsing
the
HTML
of
MediaWiki
pages
for
content
and
one
of
those
used
a
MediaWiki
template
that
included
a
minimal
style
element
to
style
the
marked
up
content
inserted
by
the
template
A
draft
of
the
newsletter
was
showing
raw
CSS
extracted
as
text
from
the
style
element
by
the
CSS
parser
extracting
content
I
was
able
to
hide
nearly
all
of
it
using
CSS
comments
around
the
CDATA
section
opener
and
closer
Except
for
that
little
bit
of
CSS
comment
noise
outside
the
CDATA
section
there
is
one
more
tool
in
our
toolbox
that
we
can
use
Simple
HTML
comments
are
ignored
at
the
start
and
end
of
style
noted
there
as
CDO
and
CDC
and
thus
we
can
use
those
to
hide
the
last
two
remaining
CSS
comment
pieces
that
were
leaking
out
like
this
and
Note
that
the
portion
of
the
HTML
comment
directives
that
are
inside
CSS
comments
are
ignored
by
CSS
processors
which
is
why
this
works
for
both
processors
that
parse
CSS
and
those
that
do
not
last
addition
produces
our
answer
with
no
fewer
than
three
different
comment
mechanisms
CDATA

HTML
overlapping

hide
each
other
from

orange
CDATA
allows
a

to

CDATA

By
replacing
those
informative

with
a

be

we
have
recreated

a

was
to

I
have
done
into
user
practices
on

This

first
in
over
months
since
last
year
s
Marin
Ultra
Challenge
and
Broken
Arrow
races
in
Saw
pal
Henri
after
changing
into
my
trail
shoes
in
the
Lake
Chabot
Regional
Park
parking
lot
The
storms
had
scared
many
away
fewer
than
showed
up
to
the
combined
start
The
muddy
rainy
adventure
began
when
we
veered
off
the
initial
paved
trail
around
the
lake
and
onto
a
rocky
uphill
stretch
It
was
mostly
an
out
course
with
a
bit
of
a
loop
in
the
middle
On
the
second
half
of
that
loop
there
was
one
fork
in
the
trail
without
race
markings
After
spending
minutes
taking
a
peek
down
both
options
I
guessed
right
About
a
half
mile
later
a
wooden
trail
post
validated
my
choice
kept
a
sustainable
run
pace
with
some
sliding
in
the
mud
stepping
around
many
ruts
and
puddles
of
unknown
depths
Slower
finish
than
years
yet
this
time
with
a
negative
split
and
earned

A
couple
of
days
ago
in
an
informal
discussion
in
the
indieweb
chat
channel
about
how
different
people
view
Mastodon
the
fediverse
or
Bluesky
and
services
like
Bridgy
BridgyFed
quite
differently
I
that
one
big
unspoken
difference
was
how
things
on
the
web
last
over
time
from
the
traditional
persistent
web
vs
the
newer
and
growing
ephemeral
web
is
the
publicly
viewable
OpenWeb
that
many
of
us
take
for
granted
meaning
the
web
that
is
persistent
that
lasts
over
time
and
thanks
to
being
curlable
that
the
Internet
Archive
archives
and
that
a
plurality
of
search
engines
see
and
index
robots
allowing
The
HTML
CSS
media
files
declarative
web
there
are
the
https
APIs
that
return
JSON
web
the
thing
that
I
ve
started
calling
the
ephemeral
web
the
set
of
things
that
are
here
today
briefly
gone
tomorrow
I
ve
previously
used
the
more
provocative
phrase
js
dr
JavaScript
required
Didn
t
Read
for
this
ephemeralWeb
yet
like
many
things
it
turns
out
there
is
a
spectrum
from
ephemeral
to
persistent
popular
example
on
that
spectrum
that
s
closer
to
the
ephemeral
edge
is
anything
on
a
Mastodon
server
running
or
later
as
of
this
writing
of
the
software
I
m
not
bothering
to
discuss
the
examples
of
walled
garden
social
media
silos
because
I
expect
we
will
continue
to
see
their
over
time
For
example
the
Internet
Archive
version
of
the
shutdown
notice
for
the
queer
af
Mastodon
server
is
visibly
blank
https
postmaster
only
a
single
Internet
Archive
snapshot
was
made
of
that
post
if
you
View
Source
you
can
find
the
entirety
of
that
queerAF
post
duplicated
across
a
couple
of
invisible
meta
tags
inside
the
raw
HTML
TL
DR
Queer
AF
will
close
on
added
to
avoid
linking
to
a
dead
domain
such
meta
tags
in
js
dr
pages
were
part
of
the
motivation
to
specify
metaformats
be
clear
the
shutdown
of
queer
af
was
a
tragedy
and
not
the
fault
of
the
creators
administrators
etc
but
rather
one
of
the
unfortunate
outcomes
of
using
some
ccTLDs
country
top
level
domains
that
risk
sudden
draconian
rules
domain
renewal
price
hikes
or
other
unpredictable
risks
due
to
the
politics
turmoil
regime
changes
etc
of
the
countries
that
administrate
such
domains
the
entirety
of
every
Mastodon
server
every
post
every
reply
is
ephemeral
a
Mastodon
server
shuts
down
all
its
posts
disappear
from
the
surface
of
the
web
forever
internet
archeologists
of
the
future
will
discover
such
dead
permalinks
check
the
Internet
Archive
find
apparent
desolation
and
a
few
of
them
will
be
curious
enough
to
use
View
Source
tools
to
unearth
parts
of
those
posts
unintentionally
preserved
inside
ceremonial
meta
tags
next
to
dead
scripts
disconnected
from
databases
and
an
empty
shell
of
a
body
All

ancient

s
observation
about
there
s
a
sort
of
Gresham
Law
of
developers
vs
users
developers
are
willing
to
use
a
forum
with
a
lot
of
users
in
it
but
users
aren
t
willing
to
use
a
forum
with
a
lot
of
developer
such
forums
are
email
lists
chat
IRC
Matrix
Slack
Discord
or
well
online
forums
Reddit
HackerNews
when
discussions
either
start
or
shift
into
technical
details
jargon
or
acronyms
users
in
a
very
broad
sense
tend
to
stop
participating
and
sometimes
leave
never
to
return
in
this
context
are
anyone
with
a
desire
or
a
preference
not
to
chat
or
even
be
bothered
spending
time
reading
about
technical
plumbing
jargon
and
see
such
discussions
as
a
distraction
at
best
and
more
like
noise
to
be
avoided
Paul
Graham
again
once
technical
details
jargon
acronyms
take
hold
it
tends
to
become
the
dominant
culture
and
discourages
users
from
showing
up
discussing
user
topics
or
even
staying
in
said
forum
IndieWeb
community
started
in
as
a
single
indiewebcamp
IRC
channel
no
email
because
it
was
tightly
coupled
to
IndieWebCamp
events
which
were
both
highly
technical
and
yet
focused
on
actually
making
things
work
on
your
personal
site
that
you
that
you
will
yourself
Conversations
bridged
real
world
use
and
technical
details
only
took
us
five
years
after
the
first
IndieWebCamp
in
Portland
to
recognize
that
the
community
had
grown
beyond
the
events
and
had
a
clear
need
for
a
separate
place
for
deep
discussions
of
developer
topics
part
of
renaming
the
community
from
IndieWebCamp
to
we
created
the
indieweb
dev
channel
for
such
technical
topics
like
protocols
formats
tools
coding
libraries
APIs
and
any
other
acronyms
or
jargon
community
did
a
good
job
of
keeping
technical
topics
in
the
dev
channel
and
encouraging
new
folks
in
the
main
indieweb
channel
who
started
technical
conversations
to
continue
them
in
the
dev
channel
Still
it
was
too
easy
for
user
topics
to
veer
into
technical
territory
It
often
felt
more
natural
to
continue
a
thread
in
the
channel
it
started
rather
than
break
to
another
channel
There
was
also
a
need
for
regular
community
labor
to
nudge
developer
conversations
to
the
developer
chat
channel
had
already
started
documenting
IndieWeb
related
on
the
wiki
and
turned
it
into
a
MediaWiki
Category
so
we
could
tag
individual
pages
as
jargon
and
have
them
automatically
show
in
a
list
Soon
after
aaronparecki
aaronpk
aaronparecki
added
a
heuristic
to
the
friendly
channel
bot
Loqi
to
recognize
when
people
started
using
jargon
in
the
main
IndieWeb
chat
channel
and
them
to
the
development
channel
Loqi
do
some
of
the
gentle
nudging
has
helped
though
it
s
still
quite
easy
for
even
the
experienced
folks
in
the
community
to
get
drawn
into
a
developer
conversation
on
main
as
it
were
ve
documented
both
a
summary
and
lengthier
descriptions
of
channel
which
help
us
remind
each
other
as
well
as
provide
a
guide
to
newcomers
experienced
community
members
and
newcomers
share
much
of
the
user
focus
of
the
IndieWeb
the
IndieWeb
being
for
whether
developer
hobbyist
or
someone
who
wants
an
independent
presence
on
the
web
without
bothering
with
technical
details
Whether
some
of
us
want
to
code
or
not
we
all
want
to
use
our
IndieWeb
sites
to
express
ourselves
on
the
web
to
use
our
sites
instead
of
depending
on
social
media
silos
That
shared
purpose
keeps
us
focused
takes
a

eternal
community
vigilance
is
the
price
of
staying
