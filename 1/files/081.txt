Python 3.12.0 (final) now available
 Finally, it’s final! The final release of Python 3.12.0 (final) is here!https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/ This is the stable release of Python 3.12.0
Python 3.12.0 is the newest major release of the Python programming 
language, and it contains many new features and optimizations.
 Major new features of the 3.12 series, compared to 3.11
 New features
More flexible f-string parsing , allowing many things previously disallowed (PEP 701).Support for the buffer protocol  in Python code (PEP 688).A new debugging/profiling API  (PEP 669).Support for isolated subinterpreters  with separate Global Interpreter Locks (PEP 684).Even more improved error messages. More exceptions potentially caused by typos now make suggestions to the user.Support for the Linux perf profiler to report Python function names in traces.Many large and small performance improvements  (like PEP 709  and support for the BOLT binary optimizer), delivering an estimated 5% overall performance improvement.
 Type annotations
New type annotation syntax  for generic classes (PEP 695).New override decorator  for methods (PEP 698).
 Deprecations
The deprecated wstr and wstr_length members of the C implementation of unicode objects were removed, per PEP 623.In the unittest module, a number of long deprecated methods and classes were removed. (They had been deprecated since Python 3.1 or 3.2).The deprecated smtpd and distutils modules have been removed (see PEP 594 and PEP 632. The setuptools package continues to provide the distutils module.A number of other old, broken and deprecated functions, classes and methods have been removed.Invalid backslash escape sequences in strings now warn with SyntaxWarning instead of DeprecationWarning, making them more visible. (They will become syntax errors in the future.)The internal representation of integers has changed in preparation 
for performance enhancements. (This should not affect most users as it 
is an internal detail, but it may cause problems for Cython-generated 
code.)
For more details on the changes to Python 3.12, see What’s new in Python 3.12.

 And now for something completely different
They have no need of our help
So do not tell me
These haggard faces could belong to you or me
Should life have dealt a different hand
We need to see them for who they really are
Chancers and scroungers
Layabouts and loungers
With bombs up their sleeves
Cut-throats and thieves
They are not
Welcome here
We should make them
Go back to where they came from
They cannot
Share our food
Share our homes
Share our countries
Instead let us
Build a wall to keep them out
It is not okay to say
These are people just like us
A place should only belong to those who are born there
Do not be so stupid to think that
The world can be looked at another way
