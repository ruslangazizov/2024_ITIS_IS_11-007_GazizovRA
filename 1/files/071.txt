The 2023 PSF Board Election is Open!
It’s time to cast your vote! Voting takes place from today Tuesday, June 20, through Friday, June 30, 2023 11:59pm UTC. If you are a voting member of the PSF, you should have gotten an email from “OpaVote Voting Link <noreply@opavote.com>” with your ballot, the subject line will read “Python Software Foundation Board of Directors Election 2023”. If you haven’t seen your ballot by Wednesday, please 1) check your spam folder for a message from “noreply@opavote.com” and if you don’t see anything 2) get in touch by emailing psf-elections@python.org so we can make sure we have the most up to date email for you. Four seats are open, but you can approve as many candidates as you like. BUT! Choose carefully before you press the big green vote button. Once your vote is cast, it cannot be changed. We’re overwhelmed by how many of you are willing to contribute to the Python community by serving on the PSF board! Make sure you schedule some time to look at all their statements and choose your candidates carefully. OpaVote doesn’t let you go back and change your vote once you’ve made your choices. Who can vote? You need to be a Contributing, Managing, Supporting, or Fellow member as of June 15, 2023 and have affirmed your voting intention by June 19, 2023 to vote in this election. Read more about our membership types here or if you have questions about your membership status please email psf-elections@python.org
