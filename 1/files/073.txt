Affirming your PSF Membership voting status 
Every PSF Voting Member (Supporting, Managing, Contributing, and Fellow) needs to affirm their membership in order to vote in this year’s election.This year’s Board Election begins June 20th, and voter eligibility cut-off is June 15th. You should have received an email with instructions and you need to affirm your voting rights before June 15th in order to participate in this year's Board Election. Email will be from "psf@psfmember.org <Python Software Foundation>" with subject "[Action Required] Affirm your PSF Membership voting status"Why you are being asked to do this: Section 4.2 of the PSF Bylaws requires that “Members of any membership class with voting rights must affirm each year to the corporation in writing that such member intends to be a voting member for such year.”The PSF has not enforced this in the past, because it was technically challenging to do so. Now that our voting membership has been completely consolidated into psfmember.org, we are able to do so.Our motivation is to ensure that our elections can meet quorum as required by Section 3.9 of our bylaws. As our membership has grown we have seen that and increasing number of Contributing, Managing, and Fellow members with indefinite membership do not engage with our annual election, making quorum difficult to reach.You can see your membership record and status on psfmember.org (note you must be logged in to view that page). If you are a voting-eligible member and do not already have a login there, please sign up and then email psf-donations@python.org so we can link your membership to your account. You can click the emailed link to re-certify without signing in. But please create your account and ensure it is linked to your membership so that we can ensure we have the most up-to-date contact information for you in the future.What happens next? You’ll get an email from OpaVote with a ballot on or before June 20th and then you can vote!Learn more about membership here or if you have questions about membership or nominations please email psf-elections@python.org In addition to Slack you are welcome to join the discussion about the PSF Board election on our forum.
