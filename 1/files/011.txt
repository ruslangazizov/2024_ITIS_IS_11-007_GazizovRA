Travel Grants Process for PyCon US 2024
Posted by
Deb Nicholson
March 07, 2024
Awarding travel grants to community members to PyCon US and seeing how much they get out of and contribute to the event is one of the most rewarding things we do at the PSF; every year, we wish we could award more. PyCon US 2024 received 852 travel grant requests totaling almost $1.5 million. With estimated revenue of $1.8M and conference costs of $2.1M, we didn’t have the funds to support every applicant. In round one, we offered $360K, or about 24%, of the grant requests received. This is a record number of travel grants received and offered.  We know many folks hoped for a grant and were disappointed not to receive one, so we wanted to share more about the process. Travel Grant Funding PyCon US travel grants are funded by various sources, from PyCon US ticket sales and sponsorships, Python Core Devs, the PSF, and generous contributions from PyLadies. In 2024, some funding sources have contracted. To date, we have not received any corporate travel grant sponsorships. Furthermore, the

PyCon US 2024 Schedule Launch. Introducing our Keynote Speakers
Posted by
Mariatta
February 28, 2024
 We’re excited to announce the full schedule for PyCon US 2024! This year, we received a record number of proposals that our Program Committee had to go through: 990 proposals! As a comparison, last year we received a little more than 700 proposals, so it’s almost 40% more proposals compared to the previous year! Thank you to everyone who submitted their proposals.   With these many proposals received, we could easily have enough speakers to fill the program for multiple Python conferences! Our volunteer Program Committee has worked hard to select only 14% among the many strong proposals to create an excellent conference program covering a wide range of subjects for attendees to enjoy. We’re looking forward to meeting all the presenters and learning from them at PyCon US 2024 . Meet Our Keynote Speakers We are thrilled to announce our Keynote speakers. Please welcome Jay Miller, Kate Chapman, Simon Willison, and Sumana Harihareswara who will be sharing their insights and perspectives o

PyCon US Hatchery is Back in 2024!
Posted by
Mariatta
January 17, 2024
We are pleased to announce the return of the Hatchery program in PyCon US 2024. What is the Hatchery program? This program offers the pathways for PyCon US attendees to introduce new tracks, activities, summits, demos, etc., at PyCon US—activities that all share and fulfill the Python Software Foundation’s mission  within the PyCon US schedule. The program began as a trial led by Ee Durbin and Naomi Ceder in 2018, resulting in the creation of several new tracks that are now staples of PyCon US, for example: PyCon US Charlas, Mentored Sprints, and Maintainer’s Summit. The Hatchery program was paused during the pandemic, and we are excited to restart and refresh this program for PyCon US 2024. With the Hatchery program, we want to provide the opportunity for you, the Python community members, to take active participation and lead new activities and events at PyCon US. We want to provide a transparent process for this, and we also want to ensure that every attendee, whether they are new t
