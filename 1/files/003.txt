https://www.python.org/jobs/7530/Scientific programmer (m/f/x) (climate modeling), Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität in Munichhttps://www.python.org/jobs/7529/Munich, Germany
<p>YOUR TASKS AND RESPONSIBILITIES:</p>
<p>Models are our main tool to project how ecosystems and climate evolve. But a key driver – the vast usage of land through agriculture, forestry and urbanization – is still lacking substantial detail in these models. This impairs our fundamental understanding of the interactions of humans, land, and climate, and is also critical as models are increasingly guiding political decision-making on land-use and climate to limit global warming. You can contribute to building the next generation of climate models, working at the intersection of numerical modeling, high-performance computing, and large-scale data analysis. You will contribute to strategic decision-making as well as to concrete design and implementation of land-use processes in our models. You will work closely with the other researchers in our group, and with external partners, e.g., in natESM, to align the group’s developments with the national and international modeling landscape. While the focus will adjust over the years with the development of the research field and success in related research proposals by our working group, it currently lies on the Earth system model ICON-ESM and its land component JSBACH4 as well as the land-use emission model BLUE, which integrates a range of Earth observational data.</p>
<p>Further tasks will be to</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>support team members in model development and setup of simulations, and convey good scientific programming skills to the team members</li>
<li>contribute to scientific publications and scientific outreach activities</li>
<li>contribute to writing proposals that advance the field of Earth system and ecosystem modeling</li>
<li>do some teaching in the study programs of the Department of Geography</li>
</ul>
<p>BENEFITS:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the chance to be part of a dynamic team working at the frontier of Earth system science</li>
<li>Initially E13 TV-L position, commensurate with work experience, for two years starting June 2024 or soon thereafter. If the candidate’s performance is satisfying it is intended to make the position permanent. A change to civil servant status (A13) is possible under certain conditions, a later promotion up to A14 is feasible.</li>
<li>career development through the LMU qualification program</li>
<li>a stimulating working environment at one of Germany’s top-ranked universities. Our institute is located in the centre of the vibrant and internationally diverse city of Munich with excellent public transportation links.</li>
</ul>
<p>Handicapped persons with comparable qualifications receive preferential status. We encourage female candidates to apply.</p>
