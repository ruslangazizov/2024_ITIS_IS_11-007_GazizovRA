Python 3.12.1 is now available
 Python 3.12.1 is now available.https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3121/ This is the first maintenance release of Python 3.12
Python 3.12 is the newest major release of the Python programming language, and it contains many new features and optimizations. 3.12.1 is the latest maintenance release, containing more than 400 bugfixes, build improvements and documentation changes since 3.12.0.
 Major new features of the 3.12 series, compared to 3.11
 New features
More flexible f-string parsing , allowing many things previously disallowed (PEP 701).Support for the buffer protocol  in Python code (PEP 688).A new debugging/profiling API  (PEP 669).Support for isolated subinterpreters  with separate Global Interpreter Locks (PEP 684).Even more improved error messages. More exceptions potentially caused by typos now make suggestions to the user.Support for the Linux perf profiler to report Python function names in traces.Many large and small performance improvements  (like PEP 709  and support for the BOLT binary optimizer), delivering an estimated 5% overall performance improvement.
 Type annotations
New type annotation syntax  for generic classes (PEP 695).New override decorator  for methods (PEP 698).
 Deprecations
The deprecated wstr and wstr_length members of the C implementation of unicode objects were removed, per PEP 623.In the unittest module, a number of long deprecated methods and classes were removed. (They had been deprecated since Python 3.1 or 3.2).The deprecated smtpd and distutils modules have been removed (see PEP 594 and PEP 632. The setuptools package continues to provide the distutils module.A number of other old, broken and deprecated functions, classes and methods have been removed.Invalid backslash escape sequences in strings now warn with SyntaxWarning instead of DeprecationWarning, making them more visible. (They will become syntax errors in the future.)The internal representation of integers has changed in preparation 
for performance enhancements. (This should not affect most users as it 
is an internal detail, but it may cause problems for Cython-generated 
code.)
For more details on the changes to Python 3.12, see What’s new in Python 3.12.
