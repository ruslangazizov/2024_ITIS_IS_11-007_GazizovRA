It's time for our annual year-end PSF fundraiser and membership drive 🎉
Support Python in 2023!  There are two ways to join in the drive this year:Donate directly to the PSF! Every dollar makes a difference. (Does every dollar also make a puppy’s tail wag? We make no promises, but may you should try, just in case? 🐶)Become a member! Sign up as a Supporting member of the PSF. Be a part of the PSF, and help us sustain what we do with your annual support.Or, heck, why not do both? 🥳 Your Donations:Keep Python thriving Invest directly in CPython and PyPI progressBring the global Python community togetherMake our community more diverse and robust every yearLet’s take a look back on 2023:PyCon US - We held our 20th PyCon US, in Salt Lake City and online, which was an exhilarating success! For the online component, PyCon US OX, we added two moderated online hallway tracks (in Spanish and English) and saw a 33% increase in virtual engagement. It was great to see everyone again in 2023, and we’re grateful to all the speakers, volunteers, attendees, and sponsors who made it such a special event.Security Developer in Residence - Seth Larson joined the PSF earlier this year as our first ever Security Developer-in-Residence. Seth is already well-known to the Python community – he was named a PSF Fellow in 2022 and has already written a lot about Python and security on his blog. This critical role would not be possible without funding from the OpenSSF Alpha-Omega Project. PyPI Safety & Security Engineer - Mike Fiedler joined the PSF earlier this year as our first ever PyPI Safety & Security Engineer. Mike is already a dedicated member of the Python packaging community – he has been a Python user for some 15 years, maintains and contributes to open source, and became a PyPI Maintainer in 2022. You can see some of what he's achieved for PyPI already on the PyPI blog. This critical role would not be possible without funding from AWS.Welcome, Marisa and Marie! - In 2023 we were able to add two new full time staff members to the PSF. Marisa Comacho joined as Community Events Manager and Marie Nordin joined as Community Communications Manager. We are excited to add two full time dedicated staff members to the PSF to support PyCon US, our communications, and the community as a whole.  CPython Developer in Residence - Our CPython Developer in Residence, Łukasz Langa, continued to provide trusted support and advancement of the Python language, including oversight for the releases of Python 3.8 and 3.9, adoption of Sigstore, and stewardship of PEP 703 (to name a few of many!). Łukasz also engaged with the community by orchestrating the Python Language Summit and participating in events such as PyCon US 2023, EuroPython, and PyCon Colombia. This critical role would not be possible without funding from Meta. Authorized as CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) - Being authorized as a CNA is one milestone in the Python Software Foundation's strategy to improve the vulnerability response processes of critical projects in the Python ecosystem. The Python Software Foundation CNA scope covers Python and pip, two projects which are fundamental to the rest of Python ecosystem.Five new Fiscal Sponsorees - Welcome to Bandit, BaPya, Twisted, PyOhio, and North Bay Python as new Fiscal Sponsorees of the PSF! The PSF provides 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status to fiscal sponsorees and provides back office support so they can focus on their missions.  Our Thanks:Thank you for being a part of this drive and of the Python community! Keep an eye on this space and on our social media in the coming weeks for updates on the drive and the PSF 👀 Your support means the world to us. We’re incredibly grateful to be in community with you!
