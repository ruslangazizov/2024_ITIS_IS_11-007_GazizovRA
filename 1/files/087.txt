Python core development news and information.

Python 3.11.4, 3.10.12, 3.9.17, 3.8.17, 3.7.17, and 3.12.0 beta 2 are now available
Greetings! Time for another combined release of six separate versions of Python!
Before you scroll away to the download links
Please test the 3.12 beta! Downloading it and trying it out helps us a
 lot in ensuring Python 3.12.0 will be as polished as possible.
We welcome 3.10 to the prestigious club of security-only releases. 
It’s officially an old version of Python now! If you haven’t rewritten 
all your if:elif:else:s with pattern matching yet, are you even still writing Python?
At the same time, it looks like 3.7 is reaching end-of-life. Unless 
another security release happens in June, 3.7.17 will be the final 
release of Python 3.7. I mean, now that I typed it out for all you to 
read, I’m sure I jinxed it. But in case I didn’t, I would like to thank 
Ned Deily for serving as the release manager of Python 3.6 and Python 
3.7. He was my mentor as Release Manager, and continues serving Python 
as the provider of Mac installers for new releases. Thank you, Ned!
Speaking of installers, Steve Dower used to be the sole provider of 
Windows installers for Python releases for years now. His secret was a 
well-automated Azure pipeline that let him build, sign, and publish 
releases with minimal manual effort. Now he extended the power to press 
the blue “Run pipeline” button to more members of the team. Thank you, 
Steve! This is an important bus factor increment. In fact, the Windows 
installers for both 3.12.0b2 and 3.11.4 were made by me initiated by me. If there’s anything wrong with them, well, I guess that means I pressed the button wrong.
Security fixes in today’s releases
Updating is recommended due to security content:
3.7 - 3.12: gh-103142:
 The version of OpenSSL used in Windows and Mac installers has been 
upgraded to 1.1.1u to address CVE-2023-2650, CVE-2023-0465, 
CVE-2023-0466, CVE-2023-0464, as well as CVE-2023-0286, CVE-2022-4303, 
and CVE-2022-4303 fixed previously in 1.1.1t (gh-101727).3.7 - 3.11: gh-102153: urllib.parse.urlsplit()
 now strips leading C0 control and space characters following the 
specification for URLs defined by WHATWG in response to CVE-2023-24329.3.7 - 3.11: gh-99889: Fixed a security in flaw in uu.decode() that could allow for directory traversal based on the input if no out_file was specified.3.7 - 3.11: gh-104049: Do not expose the local on-disk location in directory indexes produced by http.client.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler.3.7 - 3.11: gh-101283: subprocess.Popen now uses a safer approach to find cmd.exe when launching with shell=True.3.8 - 3.11: gh-103935: trace.__main__ now uses io.open_code() for files to be executed instead of raw open().3.8 - 3.11: gh-102953: The extraction methods in tarfile, and shutil.unpack_archive(), have a new filter argument that allows limiting tar features than may be surprising or dangerous, such as creating files outside the destination directory. See Extraction filters for details.3.9: gh-102126: Fixed a deadlock at shutdown when clearing thread states if any finalizer tries to acquire the runtime head lock.3.9: gh-100892: Fixed a crash due to a race while iterating over thread states in clearing threading.local.Python 3.12.0 beta 2
